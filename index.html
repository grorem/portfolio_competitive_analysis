			<td>Loud, aggressive, attention grabbing. Many bright colors on an earth-tone background which causes the figures in the foreground to be even more prominent, yet is not just a boring background by use of texturing. Hire him and your product will get people's attention.</td>

			<td>
			 Navigation at top is creative and different, yet usable format. Each navigation button takes the user to specific parts of the website that are relevant to the brand being presented by having the content within those pages clearly laid out. Making a selection in the work gallery page causes that item to come to the foreground and everything else dims out until the selection is closed. This does well in giving the user the ability to focus his or her entire attention to that one selection. Some ability to view the selection in such enhanced detail among other ones may be lost with that function, however, one can still see all the selections as a group within the 'work gallery' page. Overall, the website serves both the designer's and potential clients' goals while giving an edgy and aggressive presentation.

			<th><center>Interactivity</center></th>

		<tr>
			<td>The contact page includes a short 3-part form in which to fill out one's information for a price quote for the designer's services. Mouse-over and link-selected effects throughout</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th><center>Navigation</center></th>
			
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>A small colored tab appears on the button of the omnipresent navigation section for the selected page as an indicator of location on the site, yet it isn't enough to stand out from the attention-grabbing colors and figure of the featured graphic to really notice without looking for such a cue. This being said, the site is simple enough for the user that he or she can rely on the aforementioned cues in order to navigate the site effectively.  </td>

			<td>To the point, no flashy stuff.  Clean. Pleasant but gives a feeling of professionalism. Chooses black on light, earth-tone colors as to not be an eyesore except for links that have a red/orange color. The 'about' section includes identical descriptions side by side with one in English and the other in Spanish. Seems to be available to clientele in either category.</td>
		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<th>Functionality</th>
			
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Plenty of links on the sidebar for secondary pages which contain much related examples of work. The website shows things off effectively, however, regarding the about/contact page's bilingual nature, it would be safe to assume that he speaks and works in either language, and that he is seeking to reach out to clients in both categories; however, any ability to select full website navigation in Spanish, which would be step one in accommodating that entire set of users, seems to be absent.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Interactivity</th>
			
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>There is not a whole lot of interactivity going on here aside from a mouse-over effect or two and a color change when a link is selected. It seems to be what you see is what you get.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Navigation</th>
			
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>The red/orange contrast color makes it very obvious, yet not distractingly so, as to what is a link before even having to mouse-over. Hover creates an orange box around the link. Very apparent which link the cursor is over, but once selected the box turns to black, seems to be in keeping with the clean look but still is a good reference for where the user is in the site.</td>
