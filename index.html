			 Navigation at top is creative and different, yet usable format. Each navigation button takes the user to specific parts of the website that are relevant to the brand being presented by having the content within those pages clearly laid out. Making a selection in the work gallery page causes that item to come to the foreground and everything else dims out until the selection is closed. This does well in giving the user the ability to focus his or her entire attention to that one selection. Some ability to view the selection in such enhanced detail among other ones may be lost with that function, however, one can still see all the selections as a group within the 'work gallery' page. Overall, the website serves both the designer's and potential clients' goals while giving an edgy and aggressive presentation.

One can progress through the work examples in a sort of slide-show fashion, but the controls for such were not visible, yet there ended up being controls, however their existence was not apparent until the user moves his or her mouse over to the left or right side and arrows appear. The presentation is simple and effective, however, it would be better if the controls for the progression through the works were more apparent.

				The contact section of the page has the usual information, but only a link to send him an email is present rather than the address itself being displayed. Clicking on the link causes whatever off-line email-client software to open. This is both frustrating and ineffective for the user who does not use such software, and the lack of a separate written-out email address causes a problem for those trying to contact the designer by such means. </td>

One is not bound to this method of browsing, since he or she can easily exit out, by using the close button or just by simply clicking anywhere, and select different one from the group to perhaps make a selection based on a more holistic comparison among the examples. The home button exists at the top, but remains up there while the user scrolls down through the rest of the site, however, the functionality remains by a "top" button stylized as an arrow pointing up which takes the user back to what is essentially the home page.</td>
